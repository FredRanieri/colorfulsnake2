# ColorfulSnake Version 2.0

This new version is using Java and some OOP technic. The code is way better organized than [version 1.0](https://github.com/FredRanieri/colorfulsnake).

In one of my homework at University (2017) I worked in a version of the traditional mobile game Snake using Java. It was a homework from my University about OOP.
